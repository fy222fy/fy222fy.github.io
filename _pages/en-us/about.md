I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Cyberspace Security at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
My main research interests include artificial intelligence security, formal analysis, privacy computing, etc.

Currently, I am researching the application of large model technology in the field of formal analysis, 
as well as using formal analysis techniques to address the issue of security in artificial intelligence group interactions. 
I welcome discussions on related topics.

During my undergraduate and master’s studies, I mainly focused on the formal analysis of security protocols. 
My main work is verifying the FIDO UAF authentication protocol using formal methods. 
I proposed a formal modeling methods for inter-process communication and a verification methods for minimal assumptions in security protocols.
I developed and open-sourced an automated analysis tool, 
and published two papers at **NDSS 2021** and **TDSC 2023*, filed two patents, 
and reported a medium-risk vulnerability to CNNVD.
I also identified a vulnerability in the ProVerif formal analysis tool and contributed to its repair.

From 2021 to 2024, I worked as a network security engineer at Ant Group, 
where I was involved in cryptographic large language models, federated learning, multi-party secure computing, TEE, etc.

In the field of large language models, 
Ant Group launched the Secretflow Cloud Large Model Encryption Computing Platform in 2024. 
Based on a combination of software and hardware for trusted privacy computing technology, 
it realizes secure data transmission in the processes of large model hosting and large model inference.
I participated in the research on confidential large model inference under TEE,
developed a confidential knowledge graph platform,
and proposed a federated learning technology-based privacy-preserving joint fine-tuning/inference solution for multi-institutional scenarios.

In the field of federated learning, I implemented an automatic attack-defense framework for federated learning and open-sourced it under the Secretflow. 
The framework can automatically traverse hyperparameter traversal under given attack-defense algorithms to find the best attack-defense practices. 
Additionally, I implemented mainstream machine learning models and cutting-edge attack-defense algorithms in the framework,
establishing industry benchmarks for different models and attack-defense scenarios.

In the areas of Multi-Party Secure Computing (MPC) and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), 
Ant Group released the Trusted Encrypted Computing System (TECC) in 2022, 
which was selected as one of the “Top Ten Hardcore Technologies” at the 5th Digital China Construction Summit.
TECC primarily achieves a more secure and higher-performance encrypted computing system than standalone TEE and MPC technologies by integrating multiple heterogeneous TEE environments with Homogeneous Network MPC technology.
The work I was involved in includes the research and development of MPC operators, 
product development, adaptation for SGX and Hyperenclave TEE, as well as cloud deployment. 
I have obtained 1 software copyright and an evaluation certificate from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT).
